# Reproducibility of Structure-from-motion photogrammetry for reconstructing vegetation canopies

This repository contains summary data and the analytical codebase of manuscript 
### Repeated drone photogrammetry surveys demonstrate that reconstructed canopy heights are sensitive to wind speed but relatively insensitive to illumination conditions.

Which has been submitted for consideration for publication in Remote Sensing for Ecology and Conservation.


To explore the reproducibility of UAV-based SfM photogrammetry for vegetation monitoring, this study addressed the following research questions: 
1) Does wind speed, during the survey, influence the reconstruction of canopy heights?
2) Do illumination conditions (sun elevation and cloud cover) influence the reconstruction of canopy heights?
3) Does interpolating canopy heights between observed points influence the metrics retrieved from reconstructed canopy height models?

We captured 61 UAV SfM surveys at the same study area under a range of wind/sun/cloud conditions over a 24-day period during 2021 and used generalised linear mixed effects models to test how the structural reconstructions varied with environmental conditions.

### This Repo contains the following folders:  
"Manuscript_Scripts" folder contains the final GLMER models and other analysis with plots and annotation developed to produce figures for the Manuscript.  
"metashape_automation" contains the python scripts used to automate the processing of raw drone image data into point clouds using  Agisoft Metashape software. These scripts have been adapted to ensure the RTK enhanced location data is used during image processing.  
"HAG" folder contains scripts used to calculate DTMs and Canopy Heights for each plot and each survey.  
"survey_conditions" folder contains scripts used to investigate and plot survey conditions.    
"data" folder contains survey, plot and, extracted canopy height data.  
"output_data" folder contains figures and plots generated by scripts.    
"GCP" folder contains the scripts used to extract the elevation of the GCP surface from the survey point clouds and compare with GNSS measured elevation.  
"Analysis" folder contains scripts used to analyse the relationship between reconstructed canopy height variation and wind and illumination conditions.
