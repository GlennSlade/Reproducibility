# Reproducibility
Project investigating the reproducibility of canopy heights derived from drone acquired structure-from-motion photogrammetry.
Project aims to answer the research question:
How do wind speed and solar illumination affect the reconstruction of canopy height and prediction of aboveground biomass with structure-from-motion photogrammetry?  

We captured 61 UAV SfM surveys at the same study area under a range of wind/sun/cloud conditions over a 24-day period during 2021 and used generalised linear 
mixed effects models to test how the structural reconstructions varied with environmental conditions. 

This Repo contains:
/HAG/ folder contains scripts used to calculate DTMs and Canopy Heights for each plot and each survey
/survey_conditions/ folder contains scripts used to investigate and plot survey conditions
/data/ folder contains survey, plot and, extracted canopy height data. A csv data file is produced and saved after each survey is processed.
/output_data/ folder contains figures and plots generated by scripts
/metashape_automation/ contains the python scripts used to automate the processing of raw drone image data into point clouds using Metashape
/GCP/ folder contains the scripts used to extract the elevation of the GCP surface from the survey point clouds and compare with GNSS measured elevation
/Analysis/ folder contains scripts used to analyse the relationship between reconstructed canopy height variation and wind and illumination conditions
/Manuscript_Scripts/ folder contains the final GLMER models and other analysis with plots and annotation developed to produce figures for the Manuscript

Analysis submitted for publication in Remote Sensing for Ecology and Conservation:
Repeated drone photogrammetry surveys demonstrate that reconstructed canopy heights are sensitive to wind speed but relatively insensitive to illumination conditions.
