# Reproducibility
Project investigating the reproducibility of canopy heights derived from drone acquired structure-from-motion photogrammetry
Project aims to answer the research question:
How do wind speed and solar illumination affect the reconstruction of canopy height and prediction of aboveground biomass with structure-from-motion photogrammetry?
